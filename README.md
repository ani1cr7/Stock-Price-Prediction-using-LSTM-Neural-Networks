# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM-Neural-Networks
The project is about, predicting stock price of S&P 500 companies using deep learning.
The dataset is taken from Kaggle.com  
LSTM, Long short term memory cells are used here, these cells help in satisfying the long term dependecy problem, in other words these help in considering stuff which has happened in the past. LSTM's are variants of Recurrent neural networks, RNN's are only good for short term memory problems.
I have uploaded a paper written on the same project, it will help better understand the prediction model.
