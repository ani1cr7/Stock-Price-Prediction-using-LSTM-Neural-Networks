# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM-Neural-Networks-
The project is about, predicting stock price of S&P 500 companies using deep learning methods
The dataset is used is from Kaggle.com  
LSTM- Long short term memory cells are used here, these cells help in satisfying long term dependecy problems, in other words these help in considering stuff which has happened in the past. LSTMS are like variants of Recurrent neural networks, RNN's are only good for short term memory problems.
